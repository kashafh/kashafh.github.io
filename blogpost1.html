        <p class="font1">It's Okay to Be a Work In Progress.

            Your life force is creativity, motivation, joy, serenity,
            oneness with the universe and everything in it. These
            are gifts you've been given and you've chosen to share with others.
            It doesn't matter if you've given up or slowed down on your
            progress in life, remember these are lessons learned and ways you
            are evolving as a person and being intentional with your time and
            energy in creating your future.

            You are worthy
        </p>
        <p class="font1">Accept and Embrace Who You Are
            This will in fact help you become more confident to achieve success.
            One of the best things you can do to improve your self-confidence
            is to take a step back, look at your life objectively, and discover
            what's not working for you. It might be a good idea to do this while
            looking at others who have made similar progress, to get an idea of
            what other people are experiencing.

            Taking a step back allows you to see things objectively, which opens
            up new ideas for yourself. You'll see there's more to life than what
            you could ever imagine and that there's someone out there who can help
            if you just give them the opportunity. Life is too short to be lived
            in fear, fear of failure, or bitterness.

            Let's embrace who we are!
        </p>
        <p class="font1">Allow yourself to fully be you.
            Life is way, way too short to be anything other than the you that
            you want to be. Not the you that your parents want you to be, or
            the you that society wants you to be. But the you that is unique,
            silly, fun, outgoing, and adventurous or the you that is quiet,
            focused, creative and calm. Whatever it is that makes you feel good
            about yourself, I hope you can allow yourself to fully become that person.</p>
