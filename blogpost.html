        <p class="font1">We all grow up a bit out of place. Where do you belong? Where's “home”?

            Could you answer any of these questions with one word? I am sure that I cannot.
            This question of belonging has been increasingly reappearing in my mind in recent
            weeks as I have been contemplating where I will be this fall and the uncertainty
            and anxiousness it brings to me.

            How does one know where they belong? Where should one move to the next?
            This is one tricky question, and there is no definite answer. Life is a journey
            and not a definite destination. How boring would it be to know precisely where
            you will continue to stay, live, and work for the rest of your life? While some
            may find comfort in that, and I completely understand and respect that life,
            for many of us our true being only begins outside of our comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">“The truth about the place where you belong is that it doesn't exist
            because you haven't created it yet. Our mere existence does not necessitate our belonging.
            But our actions do. We are born with everything that we need to make a lasting imprint on
            this world to carve out a place, however humble, that aches for us whenever we leave it.A
            place that fits us. A place that grows us. A place where, come hell or high water, we belong.”
        </p>
        <p class="font1">Now more than ever, I have realized this thought above. The truth about where you
            belong is that it does not exist, but it is somewhere in the future. That place needs you to bring
            it into existence and you need it to do the same for you. It needs to make you feel alive,
            and It requires you to come alive, to fully experience the lifestyle and life to be lived there.
            To create and blend yourself into it. Most importantly it needs you to leave your lasting impression
            but first needs you to belong to it. Then eventually, you will find that you've created your own
            home at last. Just finding one place to get started and establish your roots is never a simple
            check on your to-do list. Wherever you might be in the world, whatever phase of life you're in,
            you can decide where is home by creating yourself with and from it..</p>
