        <p class="font1">What are the goals you have set for yourself? (You do set goals don't you?)
            The goals you've set might be things like owning a house, having a certain income or
            getting into a certain position with your career. Your goals might be focused on your
            relationships, your health or your contribution. You have made decisions about exactly
            what you want to have in your life. If you are setting clear objective goals with
            deadlines then you already know the role clarity plays in getting the results you want.
            As Yogi Berra said, “If you don't know where you are going you might not get there.”
            Deciding what you want is critically important to achieving anything. Most people don't
            even do that and end up becoming as Zig Ziglar says, “wandering generalities instead of
            meaningful specifics.” More Important Than Goals: There is a decision you need to make
            that is more important than the goals you set for defining what you want to have in your
            life. These are the decisions you make for defining who you want to be. Who you are will
            decide your life far more than the environment you try to create around you. Of the few
            that set clear goals for there life, few of them really ask the question, “Who do I want
            to be?”. Deciding who you want to be transcends the personal goals you set for yourself.
            Setting a goal to improve your fitness or wealth is just another “to have” goal instead
            of a “to be” goal. Making this decision doesn't have anything to do with goals at all.
            The question of who you want to be ultimately reflects your attitudes and beliefs about
            life itself.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">The decision of who you want to be will make a far bigger impact on your goals,
            your success and your happiness than anything else. In my research of what makes people happy
            and successful the same answer kept coming up, it doesn't matter what you have but what you are.
            Success comes to successful people. Seems painfully obvious, but it makes a lot more sense than
            some of the ignorant assumptions that success comes from resources, education or support. Who
            you are manifests your world more than any other factor.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">I used to feel that who you were was a constant. I used to subscribe to the notion
            that setting a “to be” goal was ridiculous because my genetics and parental upbringing made that
            decision for me. Instead, I felt, the best you could do was to expect results within the framework
            this decision had set for you. As a fairly shy and introverted kid I felt that was just a character
            trait that I would just shape my life around. Finally I realized that this whole concept was
            complete garbage. I was the one who decided who I became in my life. Nobody else. I'm not going
            to listen to some questionnaire, government study or friends and family who try to tell me who I am
            and who I am going to be. Just be your own person.</p>
